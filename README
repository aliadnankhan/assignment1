The only thing that I used that was external was the menu, that was from W3Schools.
I only used what I needed and another thing I used was the position: fixed from the same site.
Everything else was from either straight from the lecture or from the lecture code, which I used the contact form from
the week 2 lecture code. Also the gradient.
